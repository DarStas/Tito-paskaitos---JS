Tasks:
1. Write a function that will count vowels (balsÄ—) in a given word. Vowels: a, e, i, o, u.
2. Write a function that will return you boolean value based on if given word is palindrome or not. A word is considered to be palindrome only if it retains same if reversed, for example racecar, bannana.
3. Write a function to find letter occurences in a word. For example: letterCount('Connect', 'c') -> 2, because letter c occures two times.
4. Write a function to compute a union of two arrays, and removes all duplicates. For example: union([1, 2, 3], [1, 10, 2, 100]) -> [1, 2, 3, 10, 100]
5. Write a function to find a pair of elements from an given array whose sum equals a specific target number. Return an array with those two elements indexes.
For example: findNumberPairs([10, 20, 10, 40, 50, 60, 70], 50) -> [2, 3]
6. Write a function to filter false, null, undefined, 0 and empty string values from an array. It should return a new array.
For next two tasks we will be working with this data: const birds = [ "Parrots", "Falcons", "Eagles", "Emus", "Caracaras", "Egrets" ];
7. Write a function to find index of the 'Eagles' item, and use that to remove the 'Eagles' item. Return the end result which should be [ "Parrots", "Falcons", "Emus", "Caracaras", "Egrets" ]
8. Make a new array from the above array, called eBirds, that contains only birds from the original array whose names begin with the letter "E".
